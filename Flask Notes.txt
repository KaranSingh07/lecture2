Flask is micro framework for web development written in Python.

@app.route("/")
def index():
	return "Hello, World!"

	On default page("/"), run the function immediately below this.

flask run
	Run the server flask

	If doesn't start, do these...

		$env:FLASK_ENV="development"
		$env:FLASK_APP="application.py"

		**
		For UNIX/Git bash...
		export FLASK_ENV=development
		export FLASK_APP=application.py
		**
		application.py : name of python file


To render a whole HTML file...

1. Create a directory named templates.
2. Put your HTML files in templates directory.

!!---Lines to add in code---!!

	import render_template from flask

	return render_template(<<file_name.html>>)


Linking two python functions...

1. Create two functions, each one calling a different HTML file.
2. Use anchor tag as follows...
	<a href = "{{url_for('another_fn')}} " > Go to another page... </a>	

	NOTE: another_fn is the name of the function to be called when this link is clicked.


Defining a layout to stop repeatation of your code...

	See the inheritance folder. It's working is exactly the same as URLS, but using flask inheritance.


!!-- SESSIONS --!!
	Sessions are specific data of a user. Let's say we want a website storing notes for different different persons.
	We must have to display and edit the notes of current user, without revealing or affecting the notes of other.

	If we do this without sessions, see what happens in the "Session/notes without sessions" project.
	And ofcourse, to see the magic of Sessions, go to the "Session/notes with sessions" project.
